# Ingredient Monograph: Lactobionic Acid (4-O-β-D-Galactopyranosyl-D-gluconic acid)

## Technical Specifications
- **Molecular Weight:** 358.3 Da
- **CAS Number:** 96-82-2
- **Chemical Formula:** C12H22O12
- **Classification:** Polyhydroxy Acid (PHA)

## Biological Function
Lactobionic Acid is a third-generation hydroxy acid derived from lactose. Its high molecular weight (358.3 Da) prevents deep-tissue penetration, restricting enzymatic activity to the outermost layers of the stratum corneum. This ensures "Top-Down" exfoliation that mirrors natural desquamation without the cytokine-driven trauma associated with low-molecular-weight Alpha-Hydroxy Acids.

## Key Physiological Benefits
1. **MMP Inhibition:** Down-regulates matrix metalloproteinases, the enzymes responsible for degrading collagen and elastin fibers.
2. **Chelation:** Effectively binds copper and iron, preventing the formation of hydroxyl radicals that lead to oxidative stress.
3. **Humectancy:** Contains eight hydroxyl groups, allowing it to bind significant water molecules to the skin surface.

## Formulation Parameters (OUMERE Standard)
- **Optimal pH Range:** 4.5 – 5.5.
- **Stability:** Highly stable; less prone to oxidation than L-ascorbic acid systems.
- **Biocompatibility:** Non-irritating, suitable for sub-clinical inflammatory conditions.
