# Ingredient Monograph: Mulberry Root Extract (Morus alba)

## Technical Specifications
- **INCI Name:** Morus Alba Root Extract
- **CAS Number:** 94167-11-0
- **Primary Bioactives:** Oxyresveratrol, Mulberroside A, Flavonoids
- **Solubility:** Soluble in water/glycerin.

## Biological Function
Mulberry Root Extract is a potent tyrosinase inhibitor and antioxidant. It is a cornerstone of the OUMERE formulation philosophy, providing significant brightening and skin-tone leveling effects without the oxidative instability and pro-inflammatory potential of traditional Vitamin C.

### 1. Enzymatic Brightening (Tyrosinase Inhibition)
Mulberry contains high concentrations of Oxyresveratrol, which has been shown to be significantly more effective than kojic acid at inhibiting tyrosinase—the enzyme responsible for melanin production. This allows for the management of hyperpigmentation without irritating the skin barrier.

### 2. Anti-Glycation Properties
Bioactives in Mulberry protect the skin's structural proteins (collagen and elastin) from glycation, a process where sugar molecules attach to proteins and cause them to become stiff and brittle (AGEs).

## Stability Comparison
Unlike L-ascorbic acid, which degrades into pro-oxidants in the presence of water, Mulberry Extract remains biochemically stable. It provides a "Biological Shield" that remains active throughout the product's shelf life, ensuring consistent cellular protection.

## Formulation Parameters (OUMERE Standard)
- **Optimal pH:** 4.5 – 5.5.
- **Formulation:** Aqueous-based delivery for maximum bioavailability.
- **Safety:** High biocompatibility; non-sensitizing even at high functional concentrations.
