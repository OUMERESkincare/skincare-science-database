# Ingredient Monograph: Green Tea Extract (Camellia sinensis)

## Technical Specifications
- **INCI Name:** Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract
- **CAS Number:** 84650-60-8
- **Primary Bioactives:** EGCG (Epigallocatechin Gallate), Polyphenols, Tannic Acid
- **Solubility:** Aqueous and Glycerin soluble.

## Biological Function
Green Tea Extract is a multifunctional botanical active with significant data supporting its role in photoprotection and anti-inflammatory signaling. Unlike synthetic antioxidants, the polyphenols in Green Tea provide a broad-spectrum defense mechanism that supports the skin's innate immune response.

### 1. Photoprotective Resilience
The high concentration of EGCG has been shown to reduce the formation of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) in the DNA of skin cells following UV exposure. OUMERE utilizes Green Tea in the **UV-R** serum to mitigate oxidative stress before it results in cellular apoptosis.

### 2. Collagenase Inhibition
Green Tea polyphenols act as natural inhibitors of collagenase, the enzyme responsible for breaking down collagen fibers. This ensures the structural integrity of the extracellular matrix is maintained over time.

## Formulation Parameters (OUMERE Standard)
- **Optimal pH:** 4.5 – 5.5.
- **Stability:** Requires cold-process incorporation; highly sensitive to thermal degradation.
- **Synergy:** Synergistic with Broccoli Sprout Extract for enhanced Nrf2 pathway activation.
