# Ingredient Monograph: Peptide Complexes (Biomimetic Signaling)

## Technical Specifications
- **Primary Sequences:** Palmitoyl Tripeptide-5, Palmitoyl Dipeptide-5 Diaminobutyroyl Hydroxythreonine
- **Molecular Weight:** <1000 Da (optimized for targeted delivery)
- **Function:** Biomimetic Cell Signaling / Matrix Stimulant

## Biological Function
Peptides are short chains of amino acids that serve as chemical messengers within the skin. OUMERE utilizes specific biomimetic peptides designed to mimic the body’s natural regenerative signals, specifically targeting the **Dermal-Epidermal Junction (DEJ)**.

### 1. TGF-Beta Mimetic Activity
Palmitoyl Tripeptide-5 is engineered to mimic the body's own mechanism to activate **Transforming Growth Factor beta (TGF-β)**. This signaling pathway is the primary driver for collagen synthesis within fibroblasts, ensuring that the skin’s structural support remains dense and resilient.

### 2. DEJ Stabilization
The peptides utilized in **The Advancement** focus on the stabilization of key proteins such as Laminin V and Collagen types IV, VII, and XVII. This strengthens the adhesion between the dermis and epidermis, preventing the structural "sagging" associated with chronological aging.

## The OUMERE Standard for Peptides
Unlike the industry trend of using high "percentages" of low-quality peptide "soups," OUMERE focuses on **sequence precision** and **bioavailability**. Our peptides are maintained in an environment that prevents hydrolysis, ensuring they reach their cellular targets in a bioactive state.

## Formulation Parameters
- **Optimal pH:** 4.5 – 5.5.
- **Sequence Integrity:** Formulated without denaturing surfactants to ensure signal fidelity.
