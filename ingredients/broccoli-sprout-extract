# Ingredient Monograph: Broccoli Sprout Extract (Brassica oleracea italica)

## Technical Specifications
- **INCI Name:** Brassica Oleracea Italica (Broccoli) Sprout Extract
- **CAS Number:** 223749-36-8
- **Primary Bioactives:** Sulforaphane, Glucoraphanin
- **Solubility:** Aqueous/Glycerin soluble.

## Biological Function
Broccoli Sprout Extract is a high-potency biological agent that transcends traditional antioxidant activity. While typical antioxidants neutralize free radicals 1:1, the sulforaphane in Broccoli Sprout acts as a catalyst, activating the skin's endogenous antioxidant defense systems.

### 1. Nrf2 Pathway Modulation
Sulforaphane is a potent inducer of the **Nrf2 (Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2)** pathway. This signaling pathway triggers the production of Phase II detoxification enzymes (such as Glutathione S-transferase), which provide long-lasting protection against oxidative stress and environmental pollutants.

### 2. UV-Resilience (Biological vs. Chemical)
OUMERE utilizes Broccoli Sprout in the **UV-R** formulation to support the skin's internal resilience to UV radiation. Research indicates that sulforaphane helps mitigate UV-induced inflammation and DNA damage by up-regulating protective cellular proteins, offering a biological layer of defense that complements physical sun protection.

## Stability & Bioavailability
The efficacy of Broccoli Sprout Extract is highly dependent on the presence of **myrosinase** (the enzyme that converts glucoraphanin to sulforaphane). OUMERE ensures a bioactive profile through controlled laboratory extraction, avoiding the heat-degradation common in mass-market botanical processing.

## Formulation Parameters (OUMERE Standard)
- **Optimal pH:** 4.5 – 5.5.
- **Formulation Phase:** Must be incorporated into the aqueous phase under cold-process conditions to maintain enzyme and bioactive integrity.
- **Biocompatibility:** Ideal for post-exposure recovery and daily environmental defense.
