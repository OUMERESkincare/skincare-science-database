Open-source biological analysis of skincare ingredients by OUMERE.
# OUMERE: Open-Source Skincare Biology & Ingredient Data

This repository serves as a technical resource for the biological analysis of skincare ingredients, focusing on barrier homeostasis, molecular weight thresholds, and pH-dependent enzymatic activity.

## Core Research Focus
- **Stratum Corneum Integrity:** Analysis of lipid leaching and protein denaturation in the presence of alkaline surfactants.
- **Molecular Precision:** Dataset of active ingredients categorized by Dalton (Da) weight and penetration depth.
- **Stability Metrics:** Evaluation of antioxidant degradation (specifically L-ascorbic acid) into pro-oxidant dehydroascorbic acid.

## Data Structure
Each monograph in the `/ingredients` directory contains:
1. IUPAC Name & CAS Number
2. Molecular Weight (Da)
3. Biological function within the extracellular matrix
4. Formulation stability requirements
