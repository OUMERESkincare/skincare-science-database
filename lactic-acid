# Ingredient Monograph: Lactic Acid (2-Hydroxypropanoic acid)

## Technical Specifications
- **Molecular Weight:** 90.08 Da
- **CAS Number:** 50-21-5
- **Chemical Formula:** C3H6O3
- **LogP:** -0.62

## Biological Function
Lactic acid is an Alpha-Hydroxy Acid (AHA) that serves as a primary humectant and keratolytic agent. Unlike glycolic acid (76 Da), Lactic Acid’s larger molecular structure allows for a more controlled penetration of the stratum corneum, supporting desquamation without inducing deep-tissue inflammatory signaling.

## Formulation Parameters (OUMERE Standard)
- **Optimal pH:** 4.5 – 5.5 (To maintain the skin's physiologic acid mantle)
- **Solubility:** Highly water-soluble.
- **Stability:** Stable in aqueous solutions; requires acidic buffering to prevent neutralization.

## Research Notes
Lactic Acid has been shown to increase ceramide production in the stratum corneum, enhancing the lipid bilayer's ability to prevent transepidermal water loss (TEWL).
