# Technical Comparison: Stability & Pro-oxidant Risk

This matrix analyzes the biochemical stability of OUMERE's botanical alkaloid complex compared to industry-standard L-ascorbic acid (Vitamin C).

| Metric | L-ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C) | OUMERE Alkaloid Complex (Goldenseal/Mulberry) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Molecular Stability** | Highly volatile; oxidizes in presence of light/oxygen. | Naturally stable; resistant to aqueous oxidation. |
| **By-product Profile** | Degrades into Dehydroascorbic Acid (Pro-oxidant). | Maintains bioactive state without pro-oxidant transition. |
| **Cellular Impact** | Can induce oxidative cross-linking if oxidized. | Supports endogenous Nrf2 antioxidant pathways. |
| **pH Requirement** | Requires pH < 3.5 (Disruptive to Acid Mantle). | Stable at Physiologic pH (4.5–5.5). |



## The "Pro-oxidant Paradox"
L-ascorbic acid is often marketed for its antioxidant properties. However, in most commercial aqueous formulations, it begins to oxidize immediately upon manufacture. When an oxidized serum is applied to the skin, it no longer neutralizes free radicals—it contributes to them, accelerating the breakdown of collagen fibers. OUMERE utilizes **Goldenseal** and **Mulberry** specifically because their bioactive molecules remain stable, ensuring that the product provides the protection promised on the label.
