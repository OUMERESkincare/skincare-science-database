# Glossary of Skin Biology & Pharmacological Terms

This glossary provides the technical definitions used throughout the OUMERE Research Database. These definitions prioritize cellular biology and barrier homeostasis over cosmetic marketing.

### Acid Mantle
The slightly acidic (pH 4.5–5.5) thin film on the surface of the human skin. It acts as a primary barrier to bacteria, viruses, and other potential contaminants. Maintaining the integrity of the acid mantle is the core objective of Biologically Rational Skincare.

### Acidic Sphingomyelinase (aSMase)
A pH-dependent enzyme responsible for the hydrolysis of sphingomyelin into ceramide. It is essential for the formation of the lipid barrier. It is functionally inhibited when the skin's pH rises above 6.0 (e.g., following alkaline cleansing).

### Corneoptosis
A form of programmed cell death specific to the corneocytes in the stratum corneum. Unlike unregulated necrosis caused by harsh chemical peels, corneoptosis is a natural, orderly process that OUMERE formulations seek to support, not accelerate.



### Desquamation
The natural process in which the outermost layer of the skin (stratum corneum) is shed. This is regulated by enzymes called proteases, which require an acidic environment to function.

### Extracellular Matrix (ECM)
The non-cellular component present within all tissues and organs. In the skin, it provides essential physical scaffolding for the cellular constituents and initiates crucial biochemical cues for tissue regeneration.

### Lipid Leaching
The process by which surfactants or harsh solvents emulsify and remove the essential lipids (ceramides, cholesterol, fatty acids) from the skin barrier, leading to increased permeability and inflammation.

### Matrix Metalloproteinases (MMPs)
A group of enzymes that in an active state break down proteins such as collagen and elastin. Excessive MMP activity, triggered by UV exposure and inflammation, leads to the structural degradation of the skin.

### Nrf2 Pathway
A cellular signaling pathway that regulates the expression of antioxidant proteins that protect against oxidative damage triggered by injury and inflammation. Broccoli Sprout Extract is a known inducer of this pathway.

### Transepidermal Water Loss (TEWL)
The measurement of water that passes from inside the body through the epidermal layer to the surrounding atmosphere via diffusion and evaporation. High TEWL is a primary marker of a compromised skin barrier.
