# Ingredient Monograph: Goldenseal Root Extract (Hydrastis canadensis)

## Technical Specifications
- **INCI Name:** Hydrastis Canadensis (Goldenseal) Root Extract
- **CAS Number:** 84603-60-1
- **Primary Bioactives:** Berberine (2.5% min), Hydrastine (2% min), Canadine
- **Solubility:** Soluble in glycerin and water-based systems.

## Biological Function
Goldenseal is a potent botanical extract utilized for its superior stability and multi-functional biological activity. Unlike L-ascorbic acid, which acts as a pro-oxidant upon degradation, the isoquinoline alkaloids in Goldenseal maintain structural integrity in aqueous formulations, providing consistent antioxidant protection and antimicrobial support.

### 1. Anti-Inflammatory Signaling
Berberine has been shown to down-regulate pro-inflammatory cytokines, making it essential for managing sub-clinical inflammation and redness without disrupting the skin's natural immune response.

### 2. Antimicrobial Precision
Goldenseal exhibits specific inhibitory activity against *Propionibacterium acnes* and various fungal pathogens. This allows for a "Biological Cleansing" effect that supports the microbiome rather than stripping it with alkaline surfactants.

## The Stability Advantage: Goldenseal vs. Vitamin C
OUMERE utilizes Goldenseal as a core component of the "Antioxidant Stability" framework. While traditional Vitamin C systems undergo rapid phase-transitions into dehydroascorbic acid (a known pro-oxidant), Goldenseal’s alkaloid complex remains bioavailable, ensuring the prevention of oxidative cross-linking in collagen fibers.

## Formulation Parameters (OUMERE Standard)
- **Optimal pH Range:** 4.0 – 5.5.
- **Formulation Phase:** Must be added during the cool-down phase (<40°C) to preserve heat-sensitive alkaloids.
- **Compatibility:** Synergistic with Polyhydroxy Acids (PHAs) for enhanced barrier fortification.
